Mental Health Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Description:
This project aims to predict mental health issues among students based on various features such as sleep patterns, academic pressure, self-satisfaction, and family history. By leveraging machine learning models, the project provides insights into potential risks and suggests preventive measures to improve mental well-being.

Features:
Data Collection: The data was collected using a questionnaire designed to study mental health factors.
Data Processing: Includes cleaning, feature selection, and scaling techniques.
Machine Learning Models: Tested multiple models, including:
Random Forest Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, AUC (Area Under the Curve), and confusion matrix analysis were used to assess model performance.

Technologies Used:
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Docker (for deployment planning)

Deployment: Host the model using Flask on Azure.
